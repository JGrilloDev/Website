<h1>Data Communication between Client and Server</h1>
<h2>The Choice Between JSON and Plaintext</h2>
<p>
   When creating an Application that communicates with external sources, you have to 
   consider how it will communicate with them. The two ways I have encountered client
   server communication over sockets are by sending messages as a single string, or 
   by sending a dictionary using JSON. I wish to investigate both these options to find
   out which would be better for my Multi User Dungeon.
</p>
<h2>Testing Platform</h2>
<img src="Portfolio/Artefact Report/State Machine.png" class="right" title="Simple State Machine for MUD server">
<p>
   To test which of the two options is better, I will be creating a lightweight client
   that will interact with my MUD server, and I will slightly modify the server to handle
   requests from this client. I will be modifying the Check Request State to recognise
   the test requests from the lightweight client as valid responses, and the have them
   handled appropriately. </br></br>
   The testing client will be sending a single piece of information to the server and 
   will get 2 pieces of information back in response. The message sent will be the string
   "Arbitrary Message", and the information recieved will be the time at which the server
   has recieved and processed the information, and the size of the message the server 
   recieved from the client. </br></br>
   For the String test, this information will be concatenated
   and then sent, and for the JSON test, these bits of information will be under the 
   tags "msg", "time" and "size"
</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<img src="Portfolio/Artefact Report/box-plot.png" class="right" title="Time taken to receive response. String Left, JSON Right">
<p>
   For testing both the String and JSON, I was recording multiple values. 
   <ul> 
      <li>Time the message was sent from the client, </li>
      <li>Time the message was recieved from the server, </li>
      <li>Time the response was recieved by the client, </li>
      <li>Size of the message, </li>
      <li>Size of the response. </li>
   </ul>
</p>
<p>
   The box plot on the right shows the spread of time taken to recieve a response after
   the client sends the inital message. The box plot shows that (after removing some
   outliers) that while the Json has a lower mean, it also has a greater variance,
   although more testing would be necessary to confirm this isnt just due to an 
   unstable network. </br> </br>
   As for the size of the data packets, the size the Json packets were noticebly larger.
   For the outgoing messages, the string was only 17 bytes, compared to JSON which was at
   28 bytes. For the responses, the String was a small 9 bytes, where JSON remained at 
   28 bytes.
</p>
<h2>Comparison and Conclusion</h2>
<p>
   From the data presented, it seems that using Strings are an obvious choice, but 
   the situation in these methods were tested against each other was a rather simple one.
   The use of Strings sending data relies on the data being sent in a specific order,
   which can become a problem when sending multiple pieces of information. This is 
   specifically the upside of using JSON; the ease of use of the dictionary provides 
   many benefits. </br> </br>
   In the case of my Multi User Dungeon, I will continue using Strings for 
   communications, as the data that is being sent is rather simple, only being
   one command at a time. The commands are also typed into a text box and sent, so 
   given the form of Input, I would be almost taking extra steps to convert this into
   JSON. In the future, when faced with a more complex situation, I'm sure that 
   JSON will be my first choice.</br>
